Hi, my name is Volodymyr.

From the early years I felt a desire for creation thus I started from soldering my first radio transmitter.
Now I am a software developer. I live and work in Kyiv, Ukraine. I am excited about working on interesting and challenging projects and enjoy learning new technologies and new concepts.
Professionally I was mostly working with .NET stack although I am very passionate about functional languages. I think that being a good engineer does not depend on a specific programming language.
 
Apart from that, I play bass guitar in a punk rock band called [Time To Live](http://tmtlv.bandcamp.com/) and also regularly play basketball in an amateur team.

Although I do not actively use social networks, you can check my [twitter](https://twitter.com/vlysiuk) or [github](https://github.com/vlysiuk). My professional profile is available on [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/vlysiuk) or [here](/cv.html).
